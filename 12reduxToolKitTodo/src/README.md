HOW IT WORK WITH REDUX TOOLKIT AND REDUX
step 1:  create a store.js file where we create the store by configStore()it takes reducer in it with reducer name inside reducer:
step 2: then create the slice for todo................. for creating slice we need 3 things which is name,initialState,reducer 
step 3: then create the initialState for the todo 
step 4:then create the reducers which contains property and function
step 5:then for export the todo write export {reducers name which contains functionality for using that reducers}=slicename.actions
 

I create store
